Simply rap your app content with our custom ThemeProvider (more on the [theming](theming) section) with the theme of your choice... and you're ready to go! ðŸš€

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider, themes } from 'react95-native';

/* Pick a theme of your choice */
const { original } = themes;

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <ThemeProvider theme={original}>/* ... */</ThemeProvider>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```
